## 📝 Summary
This project is a web application designed to help Uyghur language authors communicate with one of the most advanced language models of the 21st century, ChatGPT, in their native language. The application uses the third-party translation API to translate user input from Uyghur to English, allowing the user to directly communicate with ChatGPT in Uyghur. The application then translates ChatGPT's English response back to Uyghur, enabling the user to receive the response in their native language. The application features a user-friendly interface with a language selection menu, input and output text areas, and a translation button. The main aim of this project is to improve the productivity of Uyghur language authors by providing them with an efficient and reliable tool for their work.
